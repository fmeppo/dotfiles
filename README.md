# fmeppo's dotfiles

Like many others, I'm beginning to manage my dotfiles via git.  The enclosed Makefile will handle updating the git repo, and verifying that dotfiles in my home directory are actually symlinks.

## Dependencies
* Assumption that this has been cloned into ~/dotfiles

## Setup
- Clone the repo into ~/dotfiles
- cd ~/dotfiles && make
